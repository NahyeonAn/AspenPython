input("Now we will start to work with the interface. Press enter to continue \n")
print("First we will try to retrieve some data about the different reactors which we are working with. \nFor this we can use the sim.Functions(), In this case we will use sim.BLK_CISTR_GET_ME_ALL_INPUTS_BACK(B1). \n")

#2. CISTR input summary
input("We will now retrieve the inputs of the CISTR which were already set by me and then print it, Press enter")

#3. Run simulation

#4. Output Summary for RPLUG

#6. Extracting singlular value ouputs
input("\n\nThese output dictionaries which we have seen until now are collections of functions but in some cases it might be useful to not extract all the different variables when we are only intersted in one.\nFor this we can for example use the sim.BLK_RCSTR_Get_HeatDuty(RCSTR). Each value inside of the dictionaries also has a corresponding single value function,\nPlease press enter")

#9. Add a new block
input("\nUntil now we have learned how to retrieve inputs and output, change inputs, run the simulation and handle errors. The next step is to learn how to edit the flowsheet.\n\nDownstream of the reactor I would like to add another new DSTWU destillation column, this will be done with sim.BlockPlace(B6, DSTWU) \n Press enter")

#11. connect streams

#12. use the dictionary to set the inputs(Refluxratio, lightkey recovery.....) for the new column
input("\nNow that we have placed the column and connected all the streams there is only one thing which is missing and that is to set the inputs of the DSTWU \nThis could be done by going through the documentation and setting each value but I am lazy, which means we will just use the same settings as the first column.\nThis is very easy since the BLK_DSTWU_GET_ME_ALL_INPUTS returns a dictionary which can be used as the input for the BLK_DSTWU_SET_INPUTS\nPress enter")
        #extract the inputs of the first DSTWU as a dictionary
OldDSTWUinputDictionary = sim.BLK_DSTWU_GET_ME_ALL_INPUTS_BACK("B1")

converged = sim.Run()
print("Was the convergence successful? ", converged , " \n")


#13. Create some reports
input("\nWe are now done with editing, we have learned how to add new equipment and streams, how to connect them and how to set the inputs for these blocks.\n\nThe next step in the process would be the creation of some reports such that we can remember this specific design which we have created.\nFor this we will save a Summary, Report and InputFile into the directory where we are currently working\nPlease press enter")

input("\n\nPlease take the time to look at the exported files, the most important ones being the TutorialReportFile and TutorialInputFile\nThese can be used to understand what design your optimization algorithm has found without needing to open it in Aspen.\nThe input file can also be loaded into aspen and it is comparable to a backupfile in that sense(except that a human can read it)\nPlease press enter to continue")

#14. Save it
input("\nAs a final step for this tutorial we will save the current Aspen file as AspenfileAfterTutorial.bkp\nPlease press enter to continue")
